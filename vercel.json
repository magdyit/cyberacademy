{
  "version": 2
}
```

That's it! Just these 3 lines. Vercel will auto-detect the `api` folder.

### **Step 2: Ensure Correct File Location**

Make absolutely sure in your GitHub repo:
```
api/analyze.js  ← Must be HERE
```

NOT:
```
analyze.js      ← Not here
```

### **Step 3: Clean Redeploy**

In Vercel:
1. **Settings** → **General** → Scroll down
2. Click **"Delete Project"** (don't worry, your code is safe in GitHub!)
3. Go back to Vercel home
4. Click **"Add New Project"**
5. **Import** your `magdyit/cyberacademy` repo again
6. **Before clicking Deploy:**
   - Click **"Environment Variables"**
   - Add: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = your API key
   - Make sure it's for **Production, Preview, and Development**
7. Click **"Deploy"**

### **Step 4: Test**

After deployment completes, visit:
